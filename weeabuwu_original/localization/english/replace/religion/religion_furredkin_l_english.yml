 furry_desc: "The Lakeshore faithful believe that existence is dictated by a series of heavily intertwined and complex cycles, chief among them the process of love and anger which the water of the Lakes undergoes. Over the course of a year, she will cycle between being the Lady or the Witch, both giving and taking life as effortlessly as the waves cresting upon the shore, depending on her mood. Lakefolk see everything as having a spirit, and they revere many in their large cosmology. However, the greatest among them is Polaris, the Great Keeper-Spirit who remains everlasting across every cycle. Responsible for bestowing the gift of Eternal Light upon the world, Polaris will always try to guide adherents safely to their destinations, despite all the turmoil which the living must undoubtedly face."
