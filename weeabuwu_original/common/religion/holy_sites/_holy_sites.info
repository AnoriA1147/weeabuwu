Faiths can have holy sites, giving various effects (mostly through references elsewhere in script).

== Structure ==
holy_site_name = {
	county = c_somewhere
    barony = b_somewhere

	flag = flag1 #Optional. faith-level effects, only conversion bonus and resistance attested
	flag = flag2

	character_modifier = { # Optional. Applied to all characters of any faith with this holy site when the holder of the barony is of their faith
		some effects
	}
}

== Localisation ==
The name of the holy site will be "holy_site_<key>_name".
The custom effect description will be "holy_site_<key>_ effects". It'll be used in addition to the character modifier (if any).
