**Description**
What's the issue, inaccuracy, or improvement you think we should add?
Note: for this template, this should be one sentence. Use "Propose an Enhancement" if it's any longer!

**Reasoning**
Why is this necessary? Consider if it's about gameplay, lore, localisation, historicity, representation, or something else.
Who might it help? How might it improve or reduce the player's experience?

**Alternative solutions**
Is there another way to fix this?
What if we do nothing?

**Additional context**
